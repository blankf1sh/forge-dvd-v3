# forge-dvd-v3

Learning to use foundry and so am using it to complete damn-vulnerable-defi v3 using forge.

1. Can just install the latest github repo straight through "forge install" 
2. edit remappings.txt in order to change damn-vulnerable-defi imports to be compatible with forge.
3. easy and logical writing tests in solidity for solidity !!!
4. vm extremely handy bit of tooling and forge in general is so quick
